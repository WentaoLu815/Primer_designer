# Primer_designer
An auto primer designer tools for everyone to design conserved sequences primer which can use detect some genes
SOP
first step:you needs to download some genes(whatever you need) from NCBI or somewhere you can find some genes 
second step: you needs to put this genes message in a fasta file which is easy for MAFFT align(MAFFT:https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/)
third step:after align this gene you can get an output file, input this file to geneious primer you can get identity message
forth step:export identity message into a csv file
fifrh step:use my program to calculate primer scores to get the most suitable primer position and i can output amplicon score if you need a position absolutely conversed
sixth stepï¼šyou can input your file to csv_start_end.py to get conversed primer position(optional)
